Open access book: "Variational Bayesian methods"
================================================


This is just a project for fun aiming to write an open book on variational
Bayesian methods in a collaborative manner.  Thus, feel free to contribute!


Currently, compiled versions of the book are available at `ReadTheDocs.org
<http://variational-bayes-book.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

The book is written in reStructuredText syntax and compiled to various outputs
by using Sphinx.  The syntax is extremely easy to write but has enough features
for a relatively complex book project.  Sphinx makes it easy to produce
different output formats such as PDF, HTML and EPUB.  If you have better ideas,
please suggest.
